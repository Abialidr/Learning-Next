        <h1>What is .env file</h1>
        <h2>
          The.env file is frequently used to store environment variables.
          Basically, an environment variable can be anything secret, and it is
          not recommended to add it directly to your source code. because if
          your source code falls into the wrong hands, they can use your secret
          keys and misuse them. <br />
          What exactly are secret keys? Essentially, services such as AWS,
          Fourspace, and others provide you with a secret key that can be used
          to access their services, and then charge you accordingly; if these
          keys fall into the wrong hands, they will be used to access your
          services, for which you have already paid. <br />
          Thus, it is preferable to use an env file and then use an env variable
          in your source code rather than using the secret key directly.

        <h1>Env file and Next js</h1>
        <h2>
          Next.js comes with built-in support for environment variables, which
          allows you to do the following:
        </h2>
        <ol class="header">
          <li>
            <h2>Use .env.local to load environment variables</h2>
          </li>
          <li>
            <h2>
              Expose environment variables to the browser by prefixing with
              NEXT_PUBLIC_
            </h2>
          </li>
        </ol>
      </section>
      <section>
        <h1>Loading Environment Variables</h1>
        <h2>An example .env.local:</h2>
        <textarea style="width: 100%" rows="5">
          
          DB_HOST=localhost
          DB_USER=myuser
          DB_PASS=mypassword
        </textarea>
        <h2>
          This loads process.env.DB_HOST, process.env.DB_USER, and
          process.env.DB_PASS into the Node.js environment automatically
          allowing you to use them in Next.js data fetching methods and API
          routes. <br /><br />
          For example, using getStaticProps:
        </h2>
        <textarea style="width: 100%" rows="11">
          
          // pages/index.js
          export async function getStaticProps() {
            const db = await myDB.connect({
              host: process.env.DB_HOST,
              username: process.env.DB_USER,
              password: process.env.DB_PASS,
            })
            // ...
          }
        </textarea>
        <h2>
          Note: In order to keep server-only secrets safe, environment variables
          are evaluated at build time, so only environment variables actually
          used will be included. This means that process.env is not a standard
          JavaScript object, so youâ€™re not able to use object destructuring.
          Environment variables must be referenced as e.g.<br />
          process.env.PUBLISHABLE_KEY, not <br />const { PUBLISHABLE_KEY } =
          process.env.
        </h2>

      <section>
        <h1>Exposing Environment Variables to the Browser</h1>
        <h2>
          By default environment variables are only available in the Node.js
          environment, meaning they won't be exposed to the browser. <br />
          In order to expose a variable to the browser you have to prefix the
          variable with NEXT_PUBLIC_. For example:
        </h2>
        <textarea style="width: 100%" rows="3">
          
          NEXT_PUBLIC_ANALYTICS_ID=abcdefghijk
        </textarea>
        <h2>
          This loads process.env.NEXT_PUBLIC_ANALYTICS_ID into the Node.js
          environment automatically, allowing you to use it anywhere in your
          code. The value will be inlined into JavaScript sent to the browser
          because of the NEXT_PUBLIC_ prefix. This inlining occurs at build
          time, so your various NEXT_PUBLIC_ envs need to be set when the
          project is built.
        </h2>
        <textarea style="width: 100%" rows="9">
          
            // pages/index.js
            import setupAnalyticsService from '../lib/my-analytics-service'
            setupAnalyticsService(process.env.NEXT_PUBLIC_ANALYTICS_ID)
            function HomePage() {
              return <h1>Hello World</h1>
            }
            export default HomePage
        </textarea>
