        <h1>What is SEO</h1>
        <h2>
          SEO stands for search engine optimization. The basic moral of using
          SEO is that Google's crawler bots can interact with our website with
          the greatest ease, and then this crawler bot helps our website be
          shown more frequently and on the first page of Google when
          searched.<br />
          Basically, maintaining friendly SEO is a technique used to boost the
          quality and quantity of traffic to our website.

        <h1>How does SEO works</h1>
        <h2>Seo Works in 3 Steps</h2>
        <h2>
          Step 1: Google bots crawl all of the sites discovered and filter them
          based on our search.<br />
          Step 2: Google bots index all websites based on their SEO performance.
          Indexing is the process of interacting with a website's metadata,
          semantics and Img alt tags. In layman's terms, Google bots are trying
          to understand our website.<br />
          Step 3: Google bots stores data in a database. After that, Google's
          bots give scores to every website whose data is stored in a database.
          Google ranks websites based on their "Click through rate," "bounce
          rate," and "dwell time." After scoring the website, Google bots assign
          a rank to it, and this rank is displayed in a list of websites. the
          better the SEO,The higher the rank ; and the higher the rank, the
          first in line. No one goes to the second or third page of Google to
          fulfil their request.

        <h2>
          A Google bot will interpret HTML as it's language and will interact
          with a website more effectively if the HTML:5  is of high quality.

        <h1>What is Pre-rendering</h1>
        <h2>
          Basically, pre-rendering is the technique of generating a static HTML
          page on the server side in advance rather than generating it on the
          client side with Javascript.

        <h1>What does Next have to do with SEO?</h1>
        <h2>
          Essentially, Next.js is the React.js framework.<br />
          Google bots have difficulty interacting with pages in React JS because
          there is no pre-rendering and all rendering is done on the client side
          using Javascript. As a result, no DOM is loaded at first, and DOM is
          loaded after JavaScript is loaded.  <br />

        <h2>Next.js solves this problem by introducing pre-rendering.</h2>
        <h2>
          By default, next.js pre-renders every page. Unlike React.js, Next.js
          will generate HTML for each page in advance rather than generating
          each page using client-side

        <h1>Advantages of Pre-rendering</h1>
        <h2>
          There are numerous benefits to pre-rendering, but the two most
          important are:

            <h2>Better performance</h2>
            <h2>
              Clients can view static HTML pages faster than react apps because
              pages are pre-rendered on the server. 
            </h2>
          </li>
          <li>
            <h2>helps with SEO</h2>
            <h2>
              As pages are pre-rendered, Google bots will see our html page
              rather than a blank page with gibberish html (React app).

        <h1>Types of Pre-rendering</h1>
        <ol class="header">
          <h2>Pre-rendering techniques are classified into three types: </h2>
          <li>
            <h2>Static Site Genration(SSG)</h2>
            <h2>
              Static Site generation basically means that all the content and
              pages are pre-rendered at build time.<br />
              it is fastest among three
            </h2>
            <image
              src="../public/SSG1.png"
              class="imageStyle"
              style="width: 500px; height: 500px"
            ></image>
            <h2><a href="./ssg.html">More Info on SSG</a></h2>
          </li>
          <li>
            <h2>Server Side Rendering(SSR)</h2>
            <h2>
              Server-side rendering means that we are rendering the data on the
              server. but at the same time, all HTML is pre-rendering on every
              request, so when you use SSR in your page, it will generate HTML
              for that page every time the request is made.
            </h2>
            <image
              src="../public/SSR1.png"
              class="imageStyle"
              style="width: 500px; height: 500px"
            ></image>
          </li>
          <li>
            <h2>Incremental site Regenration(ISR)</h2>
            <h2>
              Incremental site Regenration is similar to static generation, but
              next JS allows you to re-build this page on the server at a fixed
              interval of time(after depolyment) so that data does not become
              stale.<br />
              It has the advantages of both SSG and SSR, and it is slower than
              SSG but faster than SSR.
