        <h1>What is routing</h1>
        <h2>
          Basically routing means to open a specific file when navigated in url
          bar in browser.<br />
          Normally browser offers "History api" to do routing.<br />
          Next js Also uses HIstory API's internally to do page based routing

        <h1>various methods Next JS provides for RoutingÂ </h1>
        <ol class="header">
          <li>index routing</li>
          <li>nested routing</li>
          <li>dynamic Routing</li>

        <h1>Rules for routing</h1>
        <h2>
          In the NEXTJs, there are two basic rules for creating routing
          components.
        </h2>
        <ul class="header">
          <li>The component should be a react component that returns JSX.</li>
          <li>
            Instead of basic export, the component should be exported as
            default.
          </li>
        </ul>
      </section>

      <section>
        <h1>Index Routing</h1>
        <h2>
          Any file that is directly added to the NextJS pages folder is referred
          to as a as index routes. <br />
          index routes also point to index.js files as well. <br />
          They have no names but are directly related to their parent component.
          <br />
          for example 1, page/index.js is shown as "localhost:3000/". instead of
          "localhost:3000/index". <br />
          for example 2, Page/hello-world/index.js is shown as
          "localhost:3000/hello-world". instead of
          "localhost:3000/hello-world/index".
        </h2>
      </section>

      <section>
        <h1>Nested Routing</h1>
        <h2>
          A "nested route" is any folder that is created within a pages
          folder.<br />
          Inside this folder, index.js is the default route; any other file with
          a different name is added beside nested-route.<br />
          for example, "pages/hello-world/index.js" can be accessed by writing
          "localhost:3000/hello-world" but "pages/hello-world/hello-world.js"
          can be accessed by writing "localhost:3000/hello-world/hello-world."
        </h2>
      </section>

      <section>
        <h1>Dynamic Routing</h1>
        <h2>
          Dynamic routes are pointed toward those routes that have no name but
          an id<br />
          This is a route that can be anything. You add a dynamic id beside a
          route. to access a definite value dynamically without creating the
          same page for hundreds of times.<br />
          for example, inside an e-commerce website. <br />
          On this website, there is a static product detail page that shows
          hundreds of products dynamically. A dynamic route can now access this
          entire product by using an ID as a route.Â 
          <br /><br />
          This route can be created by naming the file " [filename].js ".
          Filname should be enclosed in square brackets.Â <br />
          To access the value of this dynamic route, you have to import the
          useRouter hook from next/router. To access value, you must first
          create a Router instance by including this statement Â ðŸ‘‡.Â  <br />
          "const router = useRouter()" <br />
          The value of a dynamic route exists inside router.query.filename.

        <h1>Linking Pages</h1>
        <h2>
          Linking all pages inside a project is also a very important part of
          routing.<br />
          Pages are linked by using the a> tag inside HTML; it can also be used
          in Next JS, but will ruin the single page application experience
          offered by Next JS.<br />
          Next.js provides the Link> tag to preserve this experience.<br />
          The link tag can connect two types of pages, including a static and
          dynamic page.<br />
        </h2>

      <section>
        <h1>Steps to link page</h1>
        <h2>
          Step 1: Import the Link tag from next/link. <br />
          Step 2: As shown below, use the link tag.<br />
          &lt;LinkÂ  href="route" &gt;&lt;a&gt;link
          name&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/Link&gt;<br />
          There are different props to this component too; please refer to this
          site to explore more. <br />
